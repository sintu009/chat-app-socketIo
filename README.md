## 1. Backend (Node.js with Express):

• Set up a Node.js server using Express.js.

• Implement a single endpoint to handle sending and receiving messages.

• Use an in-memory data structure (e.g.. array or object) to store chat messages temporarily (without using a database).

• Utilize Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients and the server.

### 2. Frontend (ReactJS):

• Create a simple ReactJS application with a single view for the chat room interface.

• Display incoming messages in real-time as they are received from the server.

• Provide an input field for users to type and send messages.

• Update the chat interface dynamically to show new messages without needing to refresh the page.
